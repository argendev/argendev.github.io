# ArgenDev's Homepage

Responsive website built with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) to be compatible with a variety of devices. Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/argendev/argendev.github.io) thanks to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and also powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Getting the environment all set up for development

Run `npm install && bower install` to fetch all the dependencies. Right after that, run `gulp` to have the server up and running (with livereload) and also to have Gulp watch your files.

The site will be now live on http://localhost:4567.

## Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

See the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) specification for more information.
